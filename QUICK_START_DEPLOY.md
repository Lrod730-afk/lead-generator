# Quick Start: Deploy to Vercel (5 Minutes)

Follow these simple steps to deploy your Lead Generator so your uncle can access it from anywhere!

## Step 1: Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

## Step 2: Login to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
```

This will open your browser - sign in with GitHub, GitLab, or email.

## Step 3: Deploy

Navigate to your project and run:

```bash
cd "/Users/lucasrodriguez/Desktop/lurod claude/lead-generator"
vercel
```

Answer the prompts:
- **Set up and deploy?** ‚Üí Press Enter (Yes)
- **Which scope?** ‚Üí Select your account
- **Link to existing project?** ‚Üí `N` (No)
- **What's your project's name?** ‚Üí `lead-generator` (or choose your own)
- **In which directory is your code located?** ‚Üí Press Enter (current directory)
- **Want to override settings?** ‚Üí `N` (No)

## Step 4: Add Environment Variable

After deployment, add your MongoDB connection:

```bash
vercel env add MONGODB_URI production
```

When prompted, paste:
```
mongodb+srv://leadgen:aI2JNQDyKqrDVrnu@cluster0.z3vjtvo.mongodb.net/leadgen?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

## Step 5: Redeploy with Environment Variable

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Done! üéâ

Your site is now live! The URL will be shown in the terminal, something like:

```
https://lead-generator-abc123.vercel.app
```

**Share this URL with your uncle!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: About the Scraper

The Google Maps scraper **will NOT work** on the deployed site because:
- Vercel has a 10-second timeout for functions
- Puppeteer (browser automation) doesn't work in serverless environments

### How to Use the Scraper:

**Option 1: Run locally, view online** (Recommended)
1. Run the scraper on your computer:
   ```bash
   node scraper.js "Miami, FL" "restaurants"
   ```
2. Data goes to MongoDB
3. Your uncle views it on the deployed site

**Option 2: Manual CSV Import**
- Use the Import page on the deployed site
- Upload CSV files with business data

---

## What Your Uncle CAN Do on the Deployed Site:

‚úÖ View all scraped leads
‚úÖ Filter and sort businesses
‚úÖ Export to CSV
‚úÖ Copy emails and phone numbers
‚úÖ Mark businesses as contacted
‚úÖ Clear all leads
‚úÖ Import CSV files

‚ùå Cannot run the scraper (must be done locally)

---

## Updating the Site

Whenever you make changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push
vercel --prod
```

Or if you connected to GitHub, just push and it auto-deploys!

---

## Custom Domain (Optional)

Want a custom URL like `leads.yoursite.com`?

1. Buy a domain (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. In Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to your project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
   - Add your domain
   - Follow the DNS setup instructions
